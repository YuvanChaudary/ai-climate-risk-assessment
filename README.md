# AI-Based Climate Risk Assessment for Agriculture 🌱

## Hackathon
Agentic AI Hackathon – IBM Granite & Langflow

## Problem Statement
Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate variability such as droughts, floods,
heatwaves, and irregular rainfall. Farmers lack access to accurate, localized,
and actionable climate risk insights, leading to crop loss and financial instability.

## Solution
We propose an AI-Based Climate Risk Assessment System using an Agentic AI architecture
deployed on IBM Cloud. The system analyzes climate and historical agricultural data
to generate crop- and region-specific risk assessments with actionable insights.

## Key Features
- Agentic AI-based climate risk analysis
- Explainable risk scores using IBM Granite
- Crop & region-specific recommendations
- Fully deployed on IBM Cloud ecosystem

## Technologies Used
- IBM Watsonx.ai
- IBM Granite Foundation Model
- Langflow
- IBM Cloud Object Storage
- RAG Architecture
